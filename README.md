# How?
Python, randomness and urllib.
# Why?
Helps with some dumb people that forget that capitalisation matters and with some args.
# Legal?
Yep
# Download?

# More info?
Supports /a/, /gallery/ and i.imgur.com links. If it bruteforces for too long, link might not exist. Use "any" mode ONLY when you don't know which mode to use, it's quite slow.
